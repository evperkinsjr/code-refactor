# Horiseon Agency - Code Refactoring

## Description

For this project, I refactoring a marketing agency website to make it more accessible. I accomplished this by:
1. Replacing the existing HTML stucture with semantic HTML elements.
2. Adding a page title.
3. Adding alt attributes to the images
4. Updating and consolidating the CSS file to match the new semantic HTML structure.
